# Invoice App

This is a minimal Vite + React wrapper to run the provided `InvoiceApp` component.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "d:\Studium\5.Semester\Softwaretechnik-Labor\TEST\invoice-app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Notes:
- The component uses `lucide-react` for icons. No Tailwind is installed; `src/index.css` contains minimal styles so the UI looks acceptable.
- To add Tailwind or further tooling, update the project accordingly.
